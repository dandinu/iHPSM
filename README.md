# iHPSM
## A chrome extension for a very tiny user group
Fair warning: If you are not employed at NTNU you will propably have next to no use of this
repo.  
This is a learning project whose main purpose is to make my day to day tasks a
little less troublesome by injectiing some code into the user interface of my
most-used tool. The deeply beloved HP Service Manager. I have no affiliation
with HP nor has they condoned the use of their name, trademark or anything
remotely connected to their business. I do not represent HP in any way.  

Fair warning 2: I have never worked with browser-extensions before, so I expect
to do things in horrible and strange ways at first. If you see me doing this I
appreciate the heads up.
